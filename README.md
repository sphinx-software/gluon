# Gluon

A data modeling framework for Fusion.

*FYI, nuclear **fusion** is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei come close enough to form one or 
more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles (neutrons or protons).*

***gluon** is an elementary particle which bonds those nuclei particles together after **fusion** reaction*
